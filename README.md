# Visualizing-a-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
The Machine Learning Algorithm Visualization in Python script demonstrates how to visualize the decision boundary of a classification algorithm using matplotlib and scikit-learn. Users can choose a classification algorithm, and the script will train the model and display the decision boundary visualization.
