# Machine Learning Algorithm Visualization in Python

## Overview

This Python script showcases the visualization of a machine learning algorithm's decision boundary using the `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn` libraries. The provided script uses a sample dataset and allows users to select a classification algorithm for visualization. Explore this script to understand how to visualize the decision boundary of a machine learning model.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the necessary libraries (`matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and others if required).
- **Dataset Loading:** Loading a sample dataset or replacing it with your own data.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Training a classification algorithm using `scikit-learn`.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization:** Plotting the decision boundary of the trained model.
- **User Input:** Code for user input to choose a classification algorithm.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the decision boundary visualization.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install matplotlib scikit-learn` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`ml_algorithm_visualization.py`) in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a classification algorithm.
4. The script will train the model and display the decision boundary visualization.

## Customization

- Replace the sample dataset with your own data for specific machine learning visualization.
- Experiment with different classification algorithms available in `scikit-learn`.
- Modify the script to include additional features or metrics relevant to your visualization.
